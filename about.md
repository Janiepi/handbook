**Praekelt Foundationâ€™s** mission is to use open source technologies to deliver essential information and inclusive services to millions of people around the world, especially in Africa. Since 2007 we have worked with governments, NGOs and social enterprises to provide people living in poverty with inspiration, education, financial services and health information.

Praekelt Foundation was founded in early 2007 by Gustav Praekelt in response to the opportunities created by the rapid and unprecedented spread of mobile phones across Africa. Gustav, a digital entrepreneur and obsessive technologist, saw how many of the mobile technologies his consultancy developed could be used to give communities access to services and information which had previously been inaccessible.
